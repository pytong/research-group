A Free yet feature rich metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content.

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called **metadata**, according to widely used standard specifications. More specifically, _Add-Meta-Tags_ can generate the _description_ and _keywords_ meta tags, _Opengraph_, _Schema.org_ microdata and JSON+LD data, _Twitter Cards_ and _Dublin Core_ metadata for your _WordPress_ content and archives, your _WooCommerce_ products and product groups, _BuddyPress_ profiles, and more.

It also supports advanced _title customization_ letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic _breadcrumb trail_ generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the _locale_ on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` link for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with _WPML_ and _Polylang_ multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin).

Add-Meta-Tags is actively maintained since 2006. Please visit the [Add-Meta-Tags historical homepage](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/).

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is one of the personal software projects of George Notaras. It is developed in his free time and released to the open source WordPress community as Free software.

- [2.9.12](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/337)
 - The *custom title* feature is now fully backwards compatible with older themes, which set the page title using the `wp_title()` template tag instead of implementing the `title-tag` theme feature, when used with WordPress 4.4. Admittedly, this should have been resolved before the WordPress 4.4 release, so apologies for any inconvenience. The plugin is tested with the latest default theme, so this issue had not been brought to my attention before the WordPress 4.4 release. Also, the changes WordPress 4.4 brought in this area hadn't been clear enough so as to know there was going to be a problem beforehand. Big thanks to all who have provided feedback.
 - Notice 1: No new features have been planned for implementation in the near future. Releases during the upcoming months will focus on performance improvements and metadata caching and bug fixes whereever necessary. Your feedback is welcome.
 - Notice 2: The file and directory layout of the plugin might change in future releases. If for any reason this might affect your workflow, please let me know.
- [2.9.11](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/336)
 - Fixed issue with WordPress 4.4 not using the custom title as expected. <strike>Backwards compatibility is maintained.</strike> Please read the following comment of mine about [how to update old themes for the WordPress 4.4 Title-Tag feature](https://github.com/gnotaras/wordpress-add-meta-tags/issues/15#issuecomment-163716554). (Props to efishinsea for reporting the issue.)
- [2.9.10](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/333)
 - Added the filter hook `amt_get_queried_object` that can be used to modify the post object that is used by the plugin for metadata generation, a feature that opens the path for support of external post types like those used by _AnsPress_. (Props to Dima Stefantsov for valuable feedback, research and code contribution.)
 - Reverted back to the old way of loading the plugin text domain for translations. Translations are now loaded as expected. (Props to Burak Yavuz for valuable feedback.)
 - The plugin options are no longer deleted on uninstallation. Please use the `amt` command of `wp-cli` to clean up data. 
 - Added filter based switches that can be used to easily [turn off metadata generation](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Filter_and_Action_Hooks#Metadata-exclusion) for all supported types of metadata.
 - Updated translations.
- [2.9.9](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/306)
 - Fixed issue with Schema.org microdata generator which did not take options into account while generating the author's Person entity. This issue affects the last two releases.
 - Updated translations.
 - Minor improvements.
- [2.9.8](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/305)
 - Refactoring of Schema.org generators for BuddyPress metadata.
 - More profile properties are now supported by the Schema.org generators. Please check the [BuddyPress Metadata Customization Guide](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Custom_Content#Metadata-for-BuddyPress) for more information. The docs now include information about how to modify or extend the generated BuddyPress metadata, override the default field map or prevent profile metadata from being added to the profile page.
 - Various improvements of the BuddyPress metadata generators. (Props to HansRuedi Keller for valuable feedback)
 - Fixed issue with author URL for Google+ which appeared on pages without author. (Props to HansRuedi Keller for valuable feedback)
 - Added support for checks of the privacy setting of each field of the BuddyPress extended profiles.
 - Fixed the BuddyPress profile URL. The profile slug is now taken into account.
 - Allow filtering of the generated local profile url through the `amt_get_local_author_profile_url` filter hook.
 - Fixed various minor issues.
 - Updated translations.
- [2.9.7](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/304)
 - Notice: The file/directory layout might change in upcoming releases.
 - Added support for the generation of metadata for _BuddyPress Profiles_. Please consult the _Extended Metadata_ section in the integrated help for more information about this new feature. This feature should be considered work in progress. Title customization is not supported yet. Many thanks to HansRuedi Keller for ideas, valuable feedback and for helping me raise my "BuddyPress IQ" at _lerngruppen.net_.
 - Added support for configurable source of local author profiles. Add-Meta-Tags, by convention, due to the lack of public profile pages in WordPress, treats the first page of the author archive as the author's profile page. This is now configurable. Please check the _Author Settings_ section in the integrated help for more information before changing this as it affects some parts of the metadata.
 - Added the `amt_local_author_profile_url()` template tag which generates a URL to the local author profile according to the relevant selection in the Add-Meta-Tags settings.
 - Added the base mechanism for bbPress support. This feature is at a very early stage of developement.
 - Various improvements of the integrated help.
 - Minor improvements of the administration interface.
 - Fixes of various minor issues.
- [2.9.6](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/303)
 - This release implements the `amt` community command of [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/). Downloading `wp-cli` is required. Learn more about the [Add-Meta-Tags command line interface](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Command_Line_Interface). This feature should be considered experimental and is currently meant to be used in testing environments, even if it seems to work fine.
 - Decoupled the *WebSite* and *Organisation* Schema.org entities on the homepage, as it is unclear whether the various services interpret them correctly when nested. Furthermore, more research about how these two entities could be nested is required. The default homepage is the only page on which Add-Meta-Tags prints decoupled schema.org objects.
 - Fixed an issue of the excerpt generator, which in some cases could reinsert shortcodes (eg Visual Composer shortcodes) and HTML tags in the excerpt. Kudos to Ceslav Przywara for spotting it and for providing useful and detailed feedback.
 - Reverted back to one-argument version of the `amt_custom_title_tag()` filtering function in order to maintain backwards compatibility. Props to Cat for reporting the issue.
 - Removed the `headline` itemprop from *Product* schema.org entities.
- [2.9.5](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/302)
 - The *Advanced Titles* feature now properly supports the management of titles of custom post type archives.
 - Metadata is now generated for archives of custom post types.
 - Reverted back to the old check of the version of the plugin settings which properly upgrades the settings whever necessary without having to access the admin interface. (props to Eddie McHam for providing useful feedback about this issue)
 - Updated the [theme requirements](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Requirements#Theme-Requirements).
 - Added extra filter that removes shortcodes which have not been properly registered using the WordPress Shortcode API.
 - Some minor modifications which should result in slightly better performance in some cases.
- [2.9.4](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/301)
 - Updated translations. The plugin now ships with a complete Greek translation. Big thanks to Michael Kotsarinis for contributing to the project!
- [2.9.3](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/300)
 - The full meta tags field is now set as translatable in the wpml-config.xml file. (props to Werner Grunberger for feedback)
 - Re-added the %title% tag expansion functionality in the custom title. (props to ndrwpvlv for feedback)
- [2.9.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/299)
 - Advanced SEO title management and customization has been built into Add-Meta-Tags. Needs to be enabled in the settings. Read [more info](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Advanced_Title_Management) about how to customize the titles. This feature is currently marked as experimental. Your feedback is welcome.
 - Option to force the use of the content's custom title, if one has been set in the post editing screen, in the titles within the metadata. By default the custom title is used only for the 'title' HTML element. (Props to fatherb, bolt24, vtinath, Craig Damon and others)
 - Fixed missing schema.org properties of video schema.org objects. (Props to Dragos for reporting the issue and for useful feedback)
 - Fixed several translatable strings. (Props to Burak Yavuz for valuable feedback.)
 - Dublin Core generator follows media item limits. (Props to Eduardo Molon for feedback.)
 - Internal media limit (configurable via filter) increased from 10 to 16. (Props to Eduardo Molon for feedback.)
 - Minor improvements of the schema.org metadata generators.
- [2.9.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/298)
 - The Twitter Cards, Opengraph and Schema.org microdata and JSON+LD generators for WooCommerce products have been greatly improved and are ready for general testing.
 - Updated the Turkish translation. (props to BouRock for tirelessly maintaining the Turkish translation)
 - Fixed issues of the JSON-LD generator with product and product group metadata. (props to Justin Flores for valuable feedback)
 - Review mode box no longer shows message about microdata when the JSON+LD generator is enabled. (props to Eduardo Molon for providing feedback)
 - Various other minor fixes and enhancements.
- [2.9.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/297)
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 1**: All help text messages and examples of the settings page have been moved to the integrated WordPress help system. This has been done in order to make the settings page easier to navigate. While at the settings page, press the `HELP` button on the top right corner and browse through the various sections in order to get detailed information about the available settings.
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 2**: It is no longer possible to enter the URLs of the Publisher's social media profiles in the WordPress user profile pages. Instead, publisher information should be entered in the relevant fields of the **Publisher Settings** section of the settings page.
 - The administration interface has been reworked.
 - Removed publisher related settings from user profile pages.
 - Improved the algorithm that collects the embedded media so that it excludes media which are just linked from the content and not embedded into the content.
 - Added option that limits the generated media metadata to one media file of each media type (image, video, audio). See `Media Limit` in the settings page. (thanks all for providing feedback about this feature - too many to list here)
 - Added support for pre-defined full meta tag sets, which can be used in the 'Full Meta Tags' box ([more info](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Plugin_Functionality_Customization#Create-Pre-Defined-Full-Meta-Tag-Sets)). (props to aferguson for ideas and feedback)
 - Re-invented the 'Express Review' feature. Admittedly, creating a review has become a little more complex, but the new way of creating reviews is as simple as it can possibly get without sacrificing flexibility. If you have an idea about how to make it even simpler, please let me know.
 - This release contains an alpha version of JSON-LD schema.org metadata generator. By enabling it in the settings, schema.org metadata is added in the head section of the web page as an `application/ld+json` script, instead of embedded microdata in the content. This feature currently exists only for testing. Your feedbackis welcome.
